# Authentication and Security Migration Sample

This sample accompanies the tutorial on [migrating authentication and security to
MobileFirst V8.0](https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/upgrading/migrating-security/).

The sample code is provided in three folders:
* The SampleHybrid71 folder contains a sample hybrid application developed for MFP Version 7.1
* The SampleCordova80 folder contains the same application after it has been migrated to MFP version 8.0
* The Adapters80 folder contains the adapters that go along with the 8.0 version of the application - the resource adapter migrated
from 7.1 to 8.0, and two adapters that contain the two security checks used to protect the resource adapter.
